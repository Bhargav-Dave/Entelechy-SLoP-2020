# Entelechy-SLoP-2020

Repository for all things related to revamping the Entelechy (The College Magazine of DA-IICT) website through web-scraping and simple web development. A good oppurtunity to learn both as a part of the project.

# What is Entelechy?

Entelechy is the college magazine of Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology. The word Entelechy traces its origin to Greek, meaning the realization of potential as opposed to the mere existence of the same. It was started in 2005 with the aim of sharing views and ideas through the means of articles and comments and has grown ever since in numbers and accesibility. Just like any college magazine, it aims to provide voice to pressing issues not only on campus but also around the world and make people engage in meaningful discussions. All of this makes the accesibility of the magazine website (currently at the URL: entelechy.daiict.ac.in) one of paramount importance.

# What we plan to do?

The current entelechy website (based primarily on PHP and WordPress) uses a lot of outdated technology and hence is extremely slow to load. To mitigate this issue and to update the technologies on which the website is being run (for improved accessibility), we are planning on making an entirely new website and scraping all the data from the previous website to add it to the new one. We're planning to use Flask and JS primarily for developing the website. (However, we are open to suggestions to using other languages and frameworks). The dvelopment of UI/UX can also go beyond just the functional and people who are wishing to work on it, are also welcome. Lastly, but most importantly, we plan to scrape the data from the old Entelechy website using BeautifulSoup or Selenium. Other than this, addition of all the previous functionality and widgets that were present in the older website to the newer one alongside the development of newer features (using preferably JS) can be done. The database structure of the website is kept as fluid, and open to deliberation.

# Technology Stack

##### Note that this is open to deliberation and discussion and a lot of technologies listed here are not final. If you deem that there are other technologies that can help us achieve our goals better, you can discuss with the mentors. More importantly, if there are technologies that you wish to learn and you think can be useful here, you are more than welcome to suggest them. Secondly, this is merely a proposed technology and is subject to change.

* Flask
* Vanilla JS
* Selenium
* Beautiful Soup
* React
